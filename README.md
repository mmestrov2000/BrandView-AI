# Project Title
**BrandView AI ‚Äì YouTube Influencer Intelligence Agent**

## Overview of the Idea
BrandView AI is a smart agent built with **Agno** that helps brands evaluate YouTube creators for influencer marketing. It analyzes channels and videos to help marketers find safe, high-performing influencers, faster and more accurately than doing manual research.

## Project Goal
To build an intelligent agent that allows brands to instantly:
1. Understand a creator‚Äôs audience and past performance  
2. Assess risk and sentiment around their content  
3. Analyze how they handle sponsorships  
4. Estimate ROI and CPM based on past metrics  
5. Discover and evaluate new talent by crawling talent agency websites  

## How It Works
Marketers interact with BrandView AI using simple chat prompts. Behind the scenes, the system (a coordinated team of specialized sub-agents) fetches YouTube data, processes it using Python-based tools, and delivers clear, actionable results. For complex calculations, a dedicated Python coder agent writes and executes code on the fly.

Each request can trigger a workflow involving:
- Resolving channel identifiers  
- Collecting channel and video data  
- Transcribing video audio to text  
- Analyzing video content for sponsor segments  
- Conducting risk and sentiment analysis  
- Running Python scripts for metric calculations  
- Crawling influencer talent agency websites to discover new collaborators  

All of this happens transparently within a single conversational interface.

### Example User Journeys:

üß† User: ‚ÄúWhat is the maximum price we should pay @GamerINF to keep CPM under $30?‚Äù  
üí¨ Agent:  
- Resolves the channel ID for @GamerINF and fetches their last 10 videos.  
- Runs a Python script to calculate average views and determine the highest price for a target CPM.  
- Response: _‚ÄúOffer no more than $5,700 to maintain a CPM below $30, based on average views of 190K.‚Äù_

üß† User: ‚ÄúShow me which brands worked with @BeautyGuru over the last year.‚Äù  
üí¨ Agent:  
- Collects video metadata and comments for @BeautyGuru‚Äôs channel.  
- Searches for sponsorship-related keywords in titles, descriptions, transcripts, and visual cues.  
- Response: _‚ÄúDetected partnerships with L'Or√©al, Sephora, and Glossier in 7 videos.‚Äù_

üß† User: ‚ÄúDiscover new influencers in the gaming niche.‚Äù  
üí¨ Agent:  
- Uses Firecrawl to crawl known influencer agency websites.  
- Extracts talent information (name, social links, niche categories, basic stats).  
- Response:  
  1. **Found Agencies**: List of relevant gaming talent agencies and their websites.  
  2. **Talent Analysis**: For each agency, extracted talent names, niches, and social profiles.  
  3. **Summary**: _‚ÄúFound 5 agencies and 27 gaming influencers, with top niches: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Plays,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpeedruns,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGame Reviews.‚Äù‚Äù_

## How It All Happens Behind the Scenes

- Individual specialized sub-agents (e.g., Channel ID Resolver, Channel Data Collector, Video Analysis Specialist, Risk & Sentiment Analyzer, Python Script Executor, Metrics Calculator, Video Statistics Specialist, Talent Specialist) coordinate under a central team orchestration to handle each task in parallel when needed.
- The Python coder agent (Python Script Executor) writes and runs code for any metric calculations or report generation.
- Firecrawl is used strictly to crawl influencer management agency websites for talent discovery‚Äînot for scraping scandal or controversy content.
- Video audio is transcribed on demand (audio‚Üítext) for deeper analysis of transcripts.
- Video content analysis (scene parsing and sponsor detection) is performed via the `analyze_video_content` tool.
- Risk and sentiment insights are drawn from comments and online searches using the `sentiment_score` tool and web search tools.
